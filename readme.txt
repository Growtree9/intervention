Less, but better.

== Description ==
Easily remove the superfluous, customising and simplifying the WordPress admin for each unique use case. Authors will appreciate a clearer, more intentional editing experience while developers spend less time on hooks, filters and support requests. 

== Features ==

In addition to being able to remove most visual elements from the WordPress admin, Intervention also enables the following options;

* Export a PHP config file of your database options to place under version control.
* Import a PHP config file to your database, useful for fast setup.
* Remove WordPress comments site-wide.
* Remove WordPress and plugin update notifications.
* Remove post types, including WordPress defaults such as `post` or `attachment`.
* Remove WordPress default image sizes, such as `medium`.
* Remove emojis site-wide.
